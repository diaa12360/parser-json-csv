Dynamic Parser using Generics and Reflection API

[TOC]


# Objective

 - Creating a `CSV parser` is your main Objective and using the parser.properties files to use the parser
 - Learning Reflection API
 - Learning Generic Classes
 - Make the Tests run successfully


# Rules

 - You are NOT allowed to Edit the interfaces
 - You are NOT allowed to Edit the test cases (You can only initialize the classes of the interfaces implementations, comments are added to guide you)
 - You are allowed to edit the parserClass inside parser.properties | path: `test/resources/parser.properties`
 - You are allowed to create as many java classes as you need to make the system work
 - You are allowed to use third party libraries
 - You can create your own logic business as long as the test cases works fine


# Optional Objective
1. Add more test cases if you see that they are necessary to be added  
2. Convert the CSV files into JSON and create a JSON parser (And make sure to use the parserClass inside parser.properties to use the JSON parser)
- to convert the CSV into JSON, you can use online websites or your brain (manual conversion), it is up to you ((:
